####Description
Write code for a genetic algorithm to solve the Knapsack Problem:. Briefly stated, the Knapsack
Problem is as follows:

You have a collection of N objects of different weights, w1, w2, …, wn, and different
values, v1, v2, …, vn, and a knapsack that can only hold a certain maximum combined
weight W. You would like to get a set of objects of maximal value into the knapsack.

As a search problem, the knapsack problem turns out to be intractable – there is no way to search
efficiently, reducing the search to an exhaustive check of all possible combinations of objects,
and the time to solve it grows exponentially with the number of objects.

Genetic algorithms, however, can quickly find solutions that come extremely close to the
maximum, while not guaranteed to actually be the maximum. A description of genetic
algorithms are found in Section 4.1.4 in your book. Read up on exactly how to implement a
genetic algorithm, and then code it up. Try it out on this test file (the format is a little strange,
but you should be able to figure it out easily).

####Deliverables
Create a short write-up that documents the parameters you used in your algorithm. Document
the variations you used and how these variations impacted solution quality. Submit this write-up
with your code and the answer to the solution you get on the test file.

####Scoring
+3 points for coding up a genetic algorithm
+2 point for exploring how variations of the algorithm impact solution quality
